        <h4>Mobile application</h4>
        <p>
        	All the monitoring tasks cannot be performed remotely. You often need human visual inspection. We have designed a mobile application to perform them and stay in touch with the experts at any time. The reporting is automatic.

        <h4>live chat+photos</h4>
        <p>
        	People on the field have not all the documentation in their bag. They are not necessarily experts. For each task, Checklist enables chatting with remote experts and the exchange of media. The line maintenance can send a photo of a situation, the expert can reply with a signed clearance.

        <p>
        	The checklists are connected as a live stream in WILCO and are stored in the history of WILCO among all the system data streams. You have complete snapshots of your systems at any time.

        <h4>offline mode</h4>
        <p>
        	Inspection tasks could occur somewhere WIFI or 3G is not reachable. We designed the application so that it works without a connection. As soon as you catch the signal, your application gets synchronized.

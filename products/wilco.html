WILCO provides a complete collection of tools to help airlines avoiding dispatch delays and improving operational efficiency. Flight data, queried remotely to the in-flight aircraft using ACARS communication stream, is analysed to immediately generate readable reports and discover opportunities for improved efficiency. 
</p>
<p>
WILCO offers a web-based in-flight Data Analysis Service which brings together a comprehensive suite of tools and expertise to unlock the value from airlinesâ€™flight data several hours before the coming dispatch. This saves airlines from dealing with rush hours during the dispatch, providing direct access to the very best analysts and methodologies available today while the aircraft is flying. The value of the tool suite will be further enhanced by Flightwatching's unique position to customize smart rules and computation models (called IFTs in the product).

Revima APU needed a health monitoring system to support its maintenance contracts and provide real time visibility on APU operations to its customers.  

Real Time APU Health Monitoring with WILCO: WILCO monitors all APU standard and abnormal reports while the aircraft is operating on the ground. It also collects in real time maintenance messages and cockpit warnings that are correlated to APU parameters in order to identify root cause of degradation. Preventive alerts have been set up by REVIMA fleet monitoring teams to avoid APU abnormal shut downs during turnarounds.

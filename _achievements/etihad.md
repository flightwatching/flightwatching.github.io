Etihad selected FlightWatching after the end of a project with Taleris that had to quit its prognostic research studies.

Our software platform was used on both Boeing and Airbus fleet : a great difference with existing tools on the market that are usually focused on one specific aircraft manufacturer. FlightWatching collaborate with MRO and more generally the Aerospace and Defense industry to provide real time health monitoring solutions. We can deliver our on-the-shelf solution “WILCO” or co design adhoc application with our customers to create predictive analysis solutions adapted to their critical needs.

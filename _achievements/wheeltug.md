Analytics on turn around times using OOOI information is not sufficient to understand how much time it takes to pushback.

More information is needed. Our teams are experts on AOC messages routed by ACMS, CMS and FMS. Analyzing the appropriate messages along with real time queries to aircraft to get more information live allowed WheelTug to understand detailed metrics on aircraft turnaround times and more specifically pushback timings. Real Time Metrics: WILCO records all useful ACARS data sent by ACMS and queries aircraft to get more data in real time. This enables to get perfect metrics on pushback timings and understand more how airlines can optimize fleet turnaround times.

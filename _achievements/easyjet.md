EasyJet, UK's largest airline, selected FlightWatching for its preventive maintenance solution applied to Airbus A320 BLEED systems. <!--break-->Aircraft were monitored during flight, collecting in real time ACARS and ADS-B. Alerts were set up to indicate abnormal trends and detection of bleed leaks. Results were presented by easyJet at an international press conference in 2014. Real Time Bleed Health Monitoring: WILCO monitors the BLEED system behavior using ACARS and AMOS data. Automatic detection of deterioration is detected before the pilot observes a Warning in the cockpit. WILCO avoids NFF, reduces PIREPS and increases aircraft dispatch reliability.

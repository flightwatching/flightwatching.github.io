# Engine FAN and CORE vibration monitoring ![Alt text](img/check_small.png?raw=true) `DFDRS ANALYSIS`

The objective of this monitoring is to monitor engine vibration levels through WILCO smart Trends. Ponderated average trends are monitored and compared to a configurable threshold to alert engineering and MCC of high levels that could lead to future TECH LOG entries and potential NOGO situations.
  

    
### Key Benefits
    OTP:  Avoids unscheduled maintenance actions, that are now replaced by 
          scheduled maintenance (relubrification, ..)
          Anticipation on servicing actions (oil supplies)
    COST: Avoided engine balance (Relubrification solved the issue)
    AOG:  High levels of ENG VIBs can lead to NOGO situations





### Dashboard
  

![Alt text](img/ENGINE_VIBRATION.png?raw=true "WILCO Trends related to Engine vibration monitoring. This example shows a continuous increase in FAN vibration that led to a recommendation of a relubrification. The step change in vibration levels after relubrification confirms that it was the right decision.")

### Return of experience
F-GSTB : Smart monitoring of Vibration levels avoids LOGBOOK entries that could potentially lead to NO GO situations.

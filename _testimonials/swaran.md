WILCO monitors the systems behavior using ACARS. The aircraft is in the conditions of the fault (engines on, flight, ...). Therefore, the root cause can be identified before landing.

With WILCO, 100% of the real-time data coming from your aircraft has now an added-value. Avoid AOG situations, outstation repairs and size your maintenance teams to optimize the dispatch.

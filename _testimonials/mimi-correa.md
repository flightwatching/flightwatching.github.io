We have demonstrated and validated the toolâ€™s effectiveness with our customers by preventing unnecessary APU removals, identifying APU and LRU component degradation and providing maintenance recommendations. The maintenance intervention from system-generated alerts enabled planned maintenance labour savings and prevented unnecessary spare parts replacement. Several Revima APU customers have expressed their support of the system, including Etihad Airways, which has been using the system for over a year on its A380 fleet.
